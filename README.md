# How to compile and run C code

Assuming you have gcc installed,

go to the terminal, 

to navigate to the directory where your C file is located,
use the `cd` command, for example:

```bash
cd path/to/your/c/file
```

Then, to compile the C file, use the `gcc` command


and run:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
```

To run the compiled program, use:

```bash
./outputname
```
