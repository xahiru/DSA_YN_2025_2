1. Write a C program to implement a stack using an array with the following operations:

    push() – to insert an element into the stack

    pop() – to remove an element from the stack

    peek() – to find the top element of the stack

    isEmpty() – to check whether the stack is empty or not

    Test Data / Expected Output:
        Create a stack object:
        Check if the stack is empty: 1
        Insert some elements onto the stack:
        Stack elements: 4 5 6 7
        Remove an element from the stack! 4
        Stack elements: 5 6 7


2. Write a C program to implement a stack using an array and structure, and calculate the average value of all elements currently stored in the stack.

    Use the following structure definition:
    
    typedef struct {
    SElemType *base;
    SElemType *top;
    int stacksize;
    } SqStack;

    Create a stack object:
    Insert some elements onto the stack:
    Stack elements: 4 5 6 7
    Average value of stack elements: 5.50
