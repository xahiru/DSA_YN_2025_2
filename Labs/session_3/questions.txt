1. Write a C program to implement a stack using an array with the following operations:

    push() – to insert an element into the stack

    pop() – to remove an element from the stack

    peek() – to find the top element of the stack

    isEmpty() – to check whether the stack is empty or not

    Test Data / Expected Output:
        Create a stack object:
        Check if the stack is empty: 1
        Insert some elements onto the stack:
        Stack elements: 4 5 6 7
        Remove an element from the stack! 4
        Stack elements: 5 6 7
